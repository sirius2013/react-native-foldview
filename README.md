FoldingCell impl in JavaScript.

#### Read it on Medium

This project was inspired by the FoldingCell animation seen on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/22981559/Mobile-Interaction-Design).
To learn more, check out the article on Medium: [Implementing FoldView in ReactÂ Native](https://commitocracy.com/).

### Example
The example app from the GIF in the README can be found at `examples/Simple`. You can also [view it with Exponent](https://exp.host/@jmurzy/react-native-foldview-simple).

### Installation

#### Using npm:

```sh
$ npm install --save react-native-foldview
```

â€” or â€”

```sh
$ yarn add react-native-foldview
```

### Usage

```javascript
```

### Platform Support
This library heavily depends on the `overflow` style property. Unfortunately, `overflow` defaults to `hidden` on Android and cannot be changed. Although it looks like a [possible fix](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/3198#issuecomment-241867280) is in the making, currently, FoldingView is only supported on iOS.
